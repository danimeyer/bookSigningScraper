Welcome to my NYC book signing scraper!

During non-covid times, I'm a big fan of attending book signings throughout the NYC area. And as the publishing houses are based here and most authors come through the city at one point or another, there are a lot of events going on!

Before learning to code, I cultivated a list of bookstore websites that I would manually visit looking for book signings I was interested in attending. But now that I'm a trained full stack developer, I figured creating a website that collects all of those events in one easy-to-check place would be a great use of my skills!

This project is currently a work-in-progress. Right now I'm in the middle of building the various scrapes and getting them to save to my database. Eventually, I plan to have the scrapes run and save automatically and render on a website that displays all of the upcoming events.

If you want to follow along with my progress, I've been live tweeting my work using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag! You can find me at @DaniMeyer_ND
